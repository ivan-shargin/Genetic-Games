# Genetic-Games
Simulation of competition among genes.
This project is for reserching, simulating for such area as "theory of games in evolution".
It was inspired by the book "Evolution and the theory of games" by J.M.Smith and "The Selfish Gene" by Richard Dawkins.
The first aim is to make a programm that will help to find ESS(Evolution Stable Strategies) in some simple games, in which alleles of the same genes are the players.
